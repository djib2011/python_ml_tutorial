# A complete tutorial in python for Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This tutorial doesn't assume any prior knowledge in python, or any other background in programming languages. 

The whole tutorial is written in jupyter notebooks, which I feel is the best platform for this sort of thing. If you want to run them locally:

- Download and install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferably python 3). Add python to your environmental variables.
- Download [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
- Install it through `python get-pip.py`.
- Install jupyter through pip: `pip install jupyter`.

If the notebooks don't render properly through github you can always view them through [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thanostagaris/python_ml_tutorial/tree/master/).
