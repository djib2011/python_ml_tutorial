    "\n",
    "Up till now, we've only seen **structured data**. Structured data, are data that are organized in a known *schema*. We know what features there are and in most cases what each feature corresponds to. Some examples of structured data are DataFrames, spreadsheets and relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, natural language is, by its nature, **unstructured**, meaning that we don't know the *schema* of the data. Finding a *structure* that describes the data is necessary in order to feed them into a ML model. This will be our main goal during this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NLP we will be using python's [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/), as well as several functions from scikit-learn. More information about the library's functionality can be found in the [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/)."

    "- **Load from a local file**.  \n",
    "If we've already downloaded the document in our computer, we'll just need to load it. We've seen how do so in a previous tutorial.\n",

    "Now, we've finally reached a point where we have an array we can feed into a ML algorithm! The above array would typically serve as our input array $X$ and depending on whether or not we have labels for each document, we would either have a supervised or an unsupervised problem. This array from this point on should be treated as any other input to a **structured** ML problem (e.g. we could shuffle it, split it into training/test sets, perform any feature scaling/selection/extraction, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to discuss a couple of interesting properties of problems involving NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first thing to note is that input arrays when dealing with natural language tend to have a **high dimensionality**, especially when using models like bag-of-words, where they treat each unique term as a new feature. This is the reason why, during this tutorial, almost all our pre-processing operations had the goal of reducing the number of terms in the corpus. Think about it:\n",
    "  - While **lowercasing** our words had the goal of mapping two different words that had the same semantic meaning (e.g. *Cat* and *cat*) to a common term, it had the much desired effect of removing a lot of would-be terms (those that have uppercase characters in them) from the vocabulary.\n",
    "  - The same can be said for **stemming/lemmatization**.\n",
    "  - **Stopword removal** had the goal of removing several terms from the vocabulary, that are too common to convey any semantic information.\n",
    "  - Removing the **least-commonly appearing terms** also had the goal of reducing the vocabulary size.\n",
    "  - As would removing the **most-common terms**, which was discussed but not performed.\n",
    "2. Another interesting thing to note about bag-of-words arrays, are how **sparse** they are (i.e. they have a lot of zero elements). This becomes even more apparent in large corpora consisting of documents talking about multiple topics. This property should be taken into account when designing the rest of the ML workflow (pre-processing steps, algorithm, etc.).\n",
    "3. When counting the number of appearances of every term in each document, no type of scaling was performed regarding the size of the document. This would have the effect of *large* documents having higher values (in the bag-of-words array) than *smaller* ones, which could be an issue if the corpus contains documents with highly-variable in length. This third point will lead us into our next technique which aims at alleviating this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "## TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better weight assignment to each term, we'll use **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "As implied by its name, tf-idf consists of 2 terms. The first one is **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ tf(t_j, d_i) = \\frac{f(t_j, d_i)}{\\sum_{t} f(t, d_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $t_j$ is a term in document $d_i$. *TF* essentially represents the frequency with which a term appears in a document. Terms with a large frequency as assigned a larger weight (and as a result are more important) than terms with a small frequency. This alleviates the problem of documents of varying length, as each term is *normalized* with the total number of terms in the document it appears in."

Total internal variance is the sum of the internal variances for all clusters.)*\n",

We'll also use two extra parameters: `max_df=x`, which ignores any terms that appear in documents with a frequency larger than `x` (i.e. the most common terms) and `max_df=y`, which ignores terms that appear less than `y` times in the corpus (i.e. the least common terms). For this example we won't be performing any stemming/lemmatizing, but the vectorizer does support this functionality (see link above).  "

    "## Final remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodologies we saw in this tutorial for converting natural language documents to a structured form, are called [Vector Space Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model). The vector used to represent a document is called an **embedding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you should take away when dealing with these types of models, is that **reducing** the size of the vocabulary (i.e. the number of dimensions) with NLP methods (stemming/lemmatization, frequent/rarest term removal, etc.), usually outperforms doing the same thing with standard ML pre-processing (feature selection, PCA, etc.). Both methods should be used with a measure; you don't want to sacrifice any important features for the sake of dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final word, unsupervised NLP problems can be **very** difficult. The categories we selected for this tutorial are easily distinguishable; a fact that helped us achieve a good performance. Don't expect this to always be the case."
